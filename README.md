#WIP: ZRI Exploration Exercise
This exploration uses Zillow's Zillow Rent Index (ZRI) data to compare median rental property value levels ($ per square foot) among various locations in New Jersey.

The ZRI is normalized using a 3-month moving average.  More about the methodology behind the ZRI can be found [here](http://www.zillow.com/research/zillow-rent-index-methodology-2393/).

In this simple exploration, I compare ZRI levels between some cities in New Jersey, and set the framework to include New York City neighborhoods.  Out of curiousity, I also compared ZRI levels in some places in New Jersey to the state unemployment rate.  Originally I wanted to see how much I could get done in 8 hours, but seeing has how the framework for a potentially interesting regression analysis is already here, I will continue to work on this project.
